        In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and 
        economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate 
        choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One 
        application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; 
        where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of 
        thousands of options.""")

        know what to recommend to you?
        \n ...it's not just a guess drawn out of the hat. There is an algorithm behind it.
        \n With this context, EDSA is challenging you to construct a recommendation algorithm 
        based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a 
        user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.
        \n What value is achieved through building a functional recommender system?
        Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, 
        with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - 
        generating revenue and platform affinity.""")
